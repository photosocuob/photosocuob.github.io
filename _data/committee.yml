      I've always been into landscapes, but I've been doing more sports photography over the past 2.5 years. I've taken
      a lot of photos at Warwickshire cricket matches this season, as well as uni rugby matches during my time here;
      I love photographing these two sports in particular!

      Last time I answered this, I said Justinian and Theodora, the Byzantine imperial power couple from the 6th century
      AD, as I was in the middle of studying them. I think photographing them would hopefully open up their true
      personalities and character, which we struggle to gain from the contemporary texts and from their mosaic at the
      Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna.
