      I've always been into landscapes, but I've been doing more sports photography over the past 2.5 years. I've taken
      a lot of photos at Warwickshire cricket matches this season, as well as uni rugby matches during my time here;
      I love photographing these two sports in particular!

      Last time I answered this, I said Justinian and Theodora, the Byzantine imperial power couple from the 6th century
      AD, as I was in the middle of studying them. I think photographing them would hopefully open up their true
      personalities and character, which we struggle to gain from the contemporary texts and from their mosaic at the
      Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna.

      Landscape photography – from mountains and forests to beaches and lakes – will always be my favourite, but lately I’ve been getting into photographing people and
      animals candidly as well. I’ve also been quite interested in learning astrophotography for a while but alas, the sky visibility of urban areas is against me in that
      venture.

      Might be an unconventional response but I’d like to photograph my grandmother! She died before I had the chance to so I think it would be cool to do so.

      Mostly landscapes, especially at night so some crossover with astro. Have done some sports (car and motorbike
      racing) photography recently too, and I like to try and get pictures of the wildlife along the river where I
      live at home. I shoot some film as well.
