We are excited to announce that we're running an organized **trip to the Lickey Hills on Sunday 5th December**.

We'll be meeting at **Old Joe at 11:00** and **catching the train from University to Barnt Green**. We will not be
providing train tickets, so you will need to buy one yourself—it's about £3 for a return *with a railcard*.

**Important:** wear clothes—and especially shoes—that you don't mind getting muddy.

We hope to see as many people there as possible! — PhotoSoc Committee
