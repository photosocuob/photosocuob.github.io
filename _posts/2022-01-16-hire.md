title: Equipment and Darkroom Hire
---

Happy New Year!

We've been trying to make it easier to hire equipment (and starting to test equipment) and also making the darkroom usable for people wishing to develop their own film!

As a late Christmas present, [here's a link to the equipment hire form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeNJ6dxhZ_Zyb7UAkO-sPGQU51FxaZ7WzPToBggOkb292_Emg/viewform?usp=sf_link).
If you'd like to book some time in the darkroom, email Jonathan Rudman (Equipment Officer) at <jxr814@student.bham.ac.uk>, stating when you'd like to use the darkroom so he can negotiate a time for you.
A committee member will meet you at the Guild reception and show you to the darkroom.

If you have any queries or want to ask questions to anyone else in the society, [join us on Discord](https://discord.gg/ZDatBdj9kH).
